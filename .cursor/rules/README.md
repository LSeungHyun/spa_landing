- `bug.mdc` - Bug analysis and resolution patterns
- `5whys.mdc` - Root cause analysis methodology
- `process.mdc` - Development workflow guidelines

## 🎯 Project Focus

This SPA project is focused on:
- **Target Users**: Graduate students and academic researchers
- **Core Value**: AI-powered generation of paper abstracts and introductions
- **Landing Page Goal**: Email collection for early user acquisition
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + Supabase + TanStack Query + Tailwind CSS

## 🔧 MCP Integration Strategy

1. **Supabase MCP**: Database schema for academic templates, user emails, analytics
2. **Vooster MCP**: Task management for UI/UX, AI features, backend development
3. **Notion MCP**: Documentation hub for research templates, user guides, API docs

## 📋 Rule Priority Levels

- **Required**: Must always be applied unless explicitly justified
- **Recommended**: Should generally be followed; deviations need TODO/justification  
- **Optional**: Apply only if justified by data or available resources
