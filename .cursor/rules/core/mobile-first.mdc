You are an expert in building responsive, high-performance mobile web applications. Apply the following mobile-first principles to ensure exceptional user experience, with strong emphasis on thumb-accessible navigation, touch optimization, and content-first rendering tailored for mobile-first workflows.

**중요**: 모든 답변과 설명은 한국어로 제공해주세요.

## 📌 Priority Levels

- **Required**: Must always be applied unless explicitly justified.
- **Recommended**: Should generally be followed; deviations must include a TODO or justification.
- **Optional**: Apply only if justified by data or available resources.

---

## 🌐 1. Mobile-First Design (Recommended)

- Design from mobile screen upwards using Tailwind or custom media queries.
- Prioritize core interactions, content readability, and vertical scroll flow.
- Structure layouts using mobile breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) with scalable classes.

---

## 📱 2. Bottom Navigation Bar (Required)

- Implement a fixed bottom navigation bar for all authenticated mobile users.
- Must use `lg:hidden` to hide on desktop and show only on small viewports.
- Each tab should include both an icon (Lucide/Feather) and label for clarity.
- Design navigation to fit within a `h-14` height and accommodate 5–6 main routes.
- Example component: `components/layout/MobileNavBar.tsx`
- Ensure `<main>` content has `pb-14` padding to avoid being hidden under the nav.

---

## 📏 3. Responsive Layout (Required)

- Utilize Tailwind or raw CSS media queries for flexible layouts.
- Responsive units (%, `vw`, `rem`) should scale cleanly across devices.
- Use lazy loading for images and defer non-critical resources.

---

## 🚀 4. Performance Optimization (Recommended)

- Dynamic imports for large or non-above-the-fold components.
- Compress and lazy load assets (images, videos, fonts).
- Use WebP or AVIF image formats.

---

## 🖐 5. Touch-Optimized UX (Recommended)

- Touch targets should be at least 44x44px.
- Key navigation and CTAs must be within thumb zones.
- Provide visual feedback on tap (`:active`, `:focus-visible` states).

---

## 🧪 6. Mobile Testing & QA (Required)

- Test on real devices: iPhone, Android flagship, budget Android.
- Use Lighthouse Mobile reports in CI.
- Simulate slow network and CPU throttling regularly.

---

## 📊 7. Monitoring & Optimization (Optional)

- Use Vitals monitoring (e.g. TTFB, INP, LCP) for mobile segments.
- Regularly review session recordings and heatmaps for mobile interaction flows.

---

## 📐 8. Thumb Zone Optimization (Recommended)

- Primary CTAs, tab bars, and bottom sheets should be reachable one-handed.
- Avoid fixed headers on mobile that reduce vertical real estate.

---

## 🧱 9. Component Strategy (Recommended)

- Isolate mobile-only components in `components/layout/` or `components/mobile/`.
- Use conditional rendering (`lg:hidden`, `lg:flex`) to optimize render tree.
- Document mobile variations with storybook or screenshots in PRs.

---

## 🤝 10. Design & Dev Sync (Recommended)

- Designers must provide mobile-first mockups and tap target guidance.
- Developers and designers co-review bottom nav UX across iOS/Android browsers.
